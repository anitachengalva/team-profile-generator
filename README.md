# Team Profile Generator

## Description

The goal of this application is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Unit tests are ran utilizing the [Jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) Node.js package, and [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) for collecting input from the user.
